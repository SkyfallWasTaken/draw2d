# Draw2D
**A work-in-progress 2D drawing library.**

This used to be a placeholder crate for a 2D drawing library on top of the `gfx-ll` crate.

## Getting started

```
cargo add draw2d
```

Then choose a renderer. If you want to just try out the API, use `draw2d_renderer_svg`.

```
cargo add draw2d_renderer_svg
```
